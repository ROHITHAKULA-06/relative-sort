The Relative Sort Algorithm is a specialized sorting technique designed to sort an array based on the order defined by a given reference array. This method is useful when you need to sort elements according to a custom order rather than the natural numerical or alphabetical order.


Example Input:
   list1 = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i","j"]
   list2 = [0,   1,   1,    0,   1,   2,   2,   0,   1,   0]

Output:
    ['a', 'd', 'h', 'j', 'b', 'c', 'e', 'i', 'f', 'g']
